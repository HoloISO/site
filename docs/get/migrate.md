Installer version 1.1 supports migration from non-immutable HoloISO release, and is available on the downloads page as of now.

There are some precautions to be taken:

1. If possible, take a backup, who knows what could possibly go wrong?
2. **DUAL-BOOTED SYSTEMS ARE NOT SUPPORTED EVEN THOUGH IT ALLOWS YOU TO DO SO, IF YOU RUN THIS ON DUAL-BOOTED SYSTEM, YOUR RANDOM PARTITIONS WITH MAJOR 3 AND 4 WILL GUARANTEEDLY GET DESTROYED.** This behavior will be fixed in future with proper instructions on how to properly migrate a dual-booted build.
3. After booting to installer, press on "Migrate RW to RO"
4. You will be asked to enter password for your current user, enter it, and grab some hot beverage while new system is being installed
5. Reboot and enjoy!
