# A Helping hand.

![alt text](image-2.png)

Hey everyone! Hope everyone's great.

A helping hand from NerdsCaveHosting's founder, Moritz Mantel have reached HoloISO.
Thanks to this partnership, HoloISO now has a stable and fast download endpoint and a fast buildserver, which would be less headaching for us to do images and release them.

Be sure to check them out at: [https://nerdscave-hosting.de/](https://nerdscave-hosting.de/)! They're insanely great at what they're doing for unbeatable value!

Be sure to test out the new servers too, as updates for both `beta` and `rel` branches have been deployed on the new endpoint!

Thanks for tuning in, and stay safe!
