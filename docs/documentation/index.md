# Documentation
HoloISO is a work-in-progress distribution that does not guarantee total compatibility with systems due to it being a total reimplementation of what Valve ships on Steam Deck.

This documentation exists as a place to properly describe the ins and outs of how HoloISO works, updates, boots and as public knowledge for everyone to read.
