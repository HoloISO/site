Contrary to some people's beliefs, HoloISO is completely open-source and will stay the same way.

All of the non-Valve changes that are made to the installation image is served by [postcopy](https://github.com/HoloISO/postcopy/) on GitHub for each respective branch.

All of the base OS components are **COMPLETELY** untouched SteamOS pacman mirror packages served by Valve's own pacman mirror on [buildroot/pacman-build-{BRANCH}.conf](https://github.com/HoloISO/buildroot/blob/master/pacman-build-beta.conf)

All of the image building/updating solutions are available on [HoloISO](https://github.com/HoloISO) organization.
